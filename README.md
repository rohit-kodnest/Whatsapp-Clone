# WhatsApp Clone

This is a simple front-end application mimicking a WhatsApp-like chat layout. 

## How to Run

Open the `index.html` file in your browser to start the application. It allows you to simulate sending messages in a basic chat interface.

For a fully functional application, additional backend implementation is required, including real-time messaging, authentication, and data storage.
